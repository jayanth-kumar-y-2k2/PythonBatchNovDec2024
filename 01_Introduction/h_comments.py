Purpose: working with the comment operator
    - Once # is encountered, complete line from that position is ignored
    - PEP 8 recommends one white space after # operator
    - comments
        - Single line comment #
        - Multi line comment - Python doesn't support

        
Question: Why python don't have multi- line comment operator
Answer  : Python is a interpreter based language, means each lines executes

Python code -> Python bytecode -> Python interpreter -> C code -> Assembly -> Machine

print('Hello world1')
"""

print('Hello world2')
# print("Hello world3")

# any operator within the quotes will be treated as an ordinary character
print("Hello #world4")
print("Hello","world5",sep="#")

print("Hello world6") # 1234567890ahguytwkjG%#%2R6EW7
print("Hello world7") # This is about the world

print("Hello world7") #
# print("Hello world8"#))
